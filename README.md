# Quiz

## Riddle me this!
![Code sample](./images/readme.png)

For this project I wanted to put my skills with JavaScript to the test, while combining my love for pop culture trivia. I need to do something with all this useless knowledge. The idea was to make a simple quiz that would track a users progress by logging how long it takes them to finish the quiz. A timer counts down starting at 60 seconds and the final time remaining can be logged with the players name. To add a little extra wrinkle the game will subtract time from the player if they get an answer wrong.

## Take aways.

Teaching myself to use object arrays to be able to dynamically change fields on a site was a big accomplishment. Also learning about the forEach method to be able to make one block of code work for four different click events all that log different info really helped open my eyes to what JS can be capable of.
